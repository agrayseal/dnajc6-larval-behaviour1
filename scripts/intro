Juvenile-onset forms of Parkinson's disease (JPD) can be caused by loss of function mutations in the *dnajc6* gene, which encodes a brain-specific isoform of auxilin. The earliest molecular mechanisms driving JPD and other neurodegenerative diseases are poorly understood. However, changes in oxidative phosphorylation and impaired lysosomal acidification have been implicated (refs).

High-throughput screening of potential drugs can be performed on zebrafish larvae in multi-well plates. To determine whether there is therapeutic benefit, a method for observing phenotypic changes is needed. Here, the behaviour of 5 day old zebrafish larvae either wildtype, heterozygous, or homozygous for the *dnajc6* gene is recorded and used to train a classifier. The ability to identify "wildtype" vs "mutant" behaviour will allow the efficacy of drugs to be assessed.
